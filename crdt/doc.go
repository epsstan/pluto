/*
Package crdt implements the needed observed-removed set (ORSet) structure upon that
the CRDT parts of pluto are built. Please note, that for correct operation and
results we expect the broadcast communication to all other replicas to be reliable
and causally-ordered.

The ORSet implementation of this package is a practical derivation from its specification
by Shapiro, Pregui√ßa, Baquero and Zawirski, available under:
https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00555588/document
