Pluto is a distributed IMAP server that implements a subset of the [IMAPv4 standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501). It makes use of [Conflict-free Replicated Data Types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) to allow state to be kept on each worker node but still achieve system-wide convergence of user data. Pluto is written in Go.


## Status

**Work in progress:** This is the code base for my Bachelor Thesis. It is heavily work in progress and not ready yet.


## Installation

If you have a working [Go](https://golang.org/) setup, installation is as easy as:

```bash
 $ go get github.com/numbleroot/pluto
```

### Certificates

There are multiple certificates needed in order to operate a pluto setup. Fortunately, you only have to provide one certificate that is valid for normal use in e.g. webservers. The other required certificates are used for internal communications among pluto's nodes and will be generated by a simple Makefile command.

So first, you need to provide a valid public TLS certificate that the distributor node can present to Internet-faced connections. It is recommended that you obtain a certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) that is accepted by most clients by default, e.g. [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). For testing though, you can use the provided `test-public` target with `make` to generate a self-signed certificate, i.e.:

```bash
$ make test-public
```

This will generate one certificate that is valid for 90 day. The target basically performs the following steps and makes use of [this script](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/crypto/tls/generate_cert.go) to generate the certificates:

```bash
$ if [ ! -d "private" ]; then mkdir private; fi
$ chmod 0700 private
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golang/go/master/src/crypto/tls/generate_cert.go
$ go build generate_cert.go
$ ./generate_cert -ca -duration 2160h -host localhost,127.0.0.1,::1 -rsa-bits 1024
$ mv cert.pem private/public-distributor-cert.pem && mv key.pem private/public-distributor-key.pem
$ go clean
$ rm -f generate_cert.go
```

Please keep in mind that the certificate generated via this command really only is to be used for testing, never in production mode. It is self-signed for localhost addresses and only of 1024 bits key length which should not be used in production anymore today.

The remaining required certificates, the mentioned internal ones, can simply be generated by running:

```bash
$ make pki
```

### User authentication

#### PostgreSQL

If you plan on using a PostgreSQL database for storing the user authorization information, you need to have a PostgreSQL running somewhere. If you need a new user that owns the database, you might use these commands on the PostgreSQL host:

```bash
user@system $ sudo -i -u postgres
postgres@system $ createuser --encrypted --pwprompt --createdb --no-createrole --no-superuser pluto
Enter password for new role:
Enter it again:
postgres@system $ exit
```

After that, you can create a new database `pluto` to hold the user information like so:

```bash
user@system $ createdb -U pluto pluto
```

#### File based (for testing purposes)
